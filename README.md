![Hello There Obi-wan](https://i.imgur.com/vku6ngY.jpg)

I am a french web developper, I am passionate about coding and I love to develop cool websites with creative design and great user experience.

[Here's an example of what I like to do](https://www.electronicmusicforpeoplewhodontlikeelectronicmusic.com/)

I am currently (as of July 2020) looking for a full time position in Montr√©al as a full stack or front-end developer. My open work permit is already valid.

I've been coding for 5 years, including 2 as a professional developer.
